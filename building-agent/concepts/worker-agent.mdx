## What a Worker Agent Is

A worker agent is a specialized runtime agent generated for a defined business process.

The coding agent creates it; the worker agent executes it.

## Sessions

A session is one execution against one input.

- Isolated shared memory and state per session
- Supports long pauses/resumes (for HITL)
- Captures complete execution history for debugging

## Iterations

Within a session, `event_loop` nodes iterate:

1. reason
2. call tools
3. evaluate output
4. retry or continue

Iteration limits prevent runaway loops.

## Headless Execution

Worker agents are designed for unattended operation:

- Continuous background execution
- Human intervention only at explicit checkpoints
- Suitable for production process automation

## Runtime Responsibilities

The runtime coordinates:

- Graph execution lifecycle
- LLM/tool access
- Shared memory and credentials
- Cost tracking and budget enforcement
- Event streaming and observability
- Crash recovery and checkpoint resume

## Practical Model

This mirrors team operations:

- define role (goal)
- provide context and tools
- set quality constraints
- automate routine actions
- escalate exceptions to humans
- evolve based on outcomes
