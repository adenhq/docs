title: "What is Aden?"
description: "Build reliable, adaptive agents with goal-driven development"

## Overview

Aden is the platform, and Hive is the open framework for building agents that adapt toward outcomes. Instead of hardcoding workflow logic, you define goals, constraints, and context, then iterate based on observed results.

## The Aden Advantage

| Traditional Frameworks | Aden + Hive |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Hardcoded workflows | Goal-driven graph generation |
| Static behavior | Outcome-based adaptation |
| Manual fallback wiring | Built-in routing and retries |
| Limited supervision | First-class human-in-the-loop nodes |

## How It Works

1. Define goals, success criteria, and constraints
2. Generate or refine the graph with coding-agent skills
3. Run agents in local or production environments
4. Evaluate outcomes and test results
5. Evolve implementation based on measured gaps

## When to Choose Aden

Choose Aden when you need:

- Long-running or multi-step autonomous workflows
- Strong control over quality, safety, and cost boundaries
- Human approval gates for sensitive actions
- A practical path from prototype to production operations
