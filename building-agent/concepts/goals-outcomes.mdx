title: "Goals and Outcomes"
description: "Define measurable success criteria, constraints, and context for Hive agents"

## The Core Idea

Hive is outcome-driven: you define what success looks like, and the agent adapts toward that result.

Instead of hardcoding every step, you define:

- A goal
- Success criteria (weighted quality checks)
- Constraints (hard and soft boundaries)
- Context (domain knowledge and preferences)

## Task-Driven vs Goal-Driven vs Outcome-Driven

| Paradigm | Main Question | Limitation |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Task-Driven | "Did each step run?" | Correct steps can still produce poor results |
| Goal-Driven | "Are we aiming correctly?" | Goals can be vague without measurable criteria |
| Outcome-Driven | "Did we produce the desired result?" | Requires clear metrics and evaluation discipline |

## Goal as a Structured Contract

In Hive, a goal is a structured object with three parts.

### Success Criteria

Each criterion defines a measurable quality signal and a weight.

Common metrics:

- `output_contains`
- `output_equals`
- `llm_judge`
- `custom`

Weights allow trade-offs across multiple quality dimensions.

### Constraints

Constraints define non-negotiables and preferences.

- Hard constraints: violation triggers failure/escalation
- Soft constraints: violation is tolerated with warning/replan

Typical categories:

- `time`
- `cost`
- `safety`
- `scope`
- `quality`

### Context

Context supplies durable background information that should influence agent decisions and LLM behavior.

## Why This Model Matters

1. The agent can self-correct during execution against explicit criteria.
2. Evolution has a target because failures map to specific unmet criteria.
3. Humans retain control through hard constraints and intervention gates.

## Goal Lifecycle

Goals typically move through:

`DRAFT -> READY -> ACTIVE -> COMPLETED | FAILED | SUSPENDED`
