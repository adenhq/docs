<Warning>
Self-hosting guidance is in active iteration. Use this page as an alpha baseline and validate against the latest `hive/README.md` before production rollout.
</Warning>

## Overview

Self-hosting Hive gives you control over runtime environment, networking, and credentials.

## Baseline Setup

1. Clone and prepare the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adenhq/hive.git
cd hive
./quickstart.sh
```

2. Configure provider credentials (for example):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

3. Run agents from your own infrastructure:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=exports uv run python -m your_agent_name run --input '{...}'
```

## Deployment Notes

- Prefer isolated environments (container, VM, or dedicated host)
- Keep credential material in secure secret stores
- Use environment-scoped configs for staging vs production
- Add observability and alerting before enabling autonomous workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Dependency setup issues

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -c "import framework, aden_tools; print('ok')"
```

### Runtime import issues

Run commands from the `hive/` project root and ensure `PYTHONPATH=exports` is set.
