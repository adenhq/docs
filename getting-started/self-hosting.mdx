Self-hosting is currently in alpha stage and is planned for a major revamp soon.

## Overview

Self-hosting Aden gives you complete control over your deployment, data, and infrastructure. This guide walks you through setting up Aden using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Docker" icon="docker">
    Docker Engine 20.10+ and Docker Compose v2+
  </Card>
  <Card title="Git" icon="git">
    Git for cloning the repository
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Get a copy of the latest Aden repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adenhq/beeline
cd beeline
```

### Step 2: Run Docker Compose

Start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start:
- Aden API server
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Cache layer (Redis)
- Web dashboard

### Step 3: Access the Dashboard

Once the services are running, access the Aden dashboard at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Configuration

The default `config.yaml` file comes with sensible defaults for quick testing. You only need to modify it for production deployments or custom requirements.

### Key Configuration Options

If you need to customize your deployment, edit the `config.yaml` file in the repository:

**Server Ports** (if ports 3000/4000 are already in use):
```yaml
server:
  frontend:
    port: 3000  # Change to your desired frontend port
  backend:
    port: 4000  # Change to your desired backend port
```

**Database Connection** (for external database):
```yaml
database:
  url: postgresql://honeycomb:honeycomb@localhost:5432/honeycomb
  # Update with your database credentials and host
```

**Security** (required for production):
```yaml
auth:
  jwt_secret: change-this-to-a-secure-random-string
  # Generate a secure secret with: openssl rand -base64 32
  jwt_expires_in: 7d
```

**CORS Settings** (for production deployments):
```yaml
cors:
  origin: http://localhost:3000
  # Change to your production frontend URL
```

**Application Environment**:
```yaml
app:
  environment: development  # Change to 'production' for production
  log_level: info  # Options: debug, info, warn, error
```

### Advanced Docker Compose Customization

For advanced configurations, you can also modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to:
- Change port mappings
- Add volume mounts for persistence
- Configure resource limits
- Set up external networks

## Connecting Your SDKs

After deployment, configure your SDKs to point to your self-hosted instance:

<Note>
  Use `http://localhost:4000` as the server URL for self-hosted instances.

    ```typescript
    import { instrument } from "aden-ts";

    await instrument({
      apiKey: "your-api-key",
      serverUrl: "http://localhost:8080", // Your self-hosted URL. Use http://localhost:4000 instead.
      sdks: { OpenAI },
    });
    ```

    from aden import instrument, MeterOptions

    instrument(MeterOptions(
        api_key="your-api-key",
        server_url="http://localhost:8080",  # Your self-hosted URL. Use http://localhost:4000 instead.
    ))
    ```

## Updating

To update your self-hosted Aden instance:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Rebuild and restart services
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

Check Docker logs for specific errors:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```
