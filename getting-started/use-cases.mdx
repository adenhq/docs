description: "Ready-to-run agent templates for real business processes — start from a template, customize it, and deploy"
---

Hive ships with agent templates you can run immediately or use as a starting point for your own agents. Each template is a complete, working agent that covers a real business process.

<Tip>
Every template can be run as-is with `hive tui` or customized to fit your needs. See [Build From Existing Agent](/building/build-with-existing-agent) for the customization workflow.

## Starter Templates

These are the best starting points — simple enough to understand in minutes, useful enough to deploy immediately.

## Using a Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse and pick a template">
    Run `hive tui` to browse available agents, or explore the `examples/templates/` directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run it as-is">
    Test the template to see how it works. Hive validates prerequisites and runs the agent automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize for your needs">
    Copy the template, update the goal, adjust nodes and edges, and make it yours. See [Build From Existing Agent](/building/build-with-existing-agent).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to production">
    Once you're happy with the results, [deploy](/building/deployment) your customized agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Can't Find What You Need?

If your use case isn't covered by an existing template, you can generate a custom agent from scratch using your coding agent. Run `claude> /hive` to start a guided agent creation session, or see [Build Your First Agent](/building/first-agent).

You can also share your use case in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MXE49hrKDk) — the community might already have a solution, or your idea could become the next template.
