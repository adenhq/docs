Hive is designed for developers who are ready to move past demos and build AI agents that actually run in production. Whether you're automating processes for clients, building a product, or streamlining your own business — Hive helps you get there.

## Developer Profiles

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Developers Who Want to Get a Job Done" icon="wrench">
    You have a real-world business process that needs automating. You're researching solutions and want something that works — not a science project.

    **What success looks like for you:**
    1. Deploy an agent to production and get users to use it
    2. Own the business process and know how to maintain it
    3. Add integrations and expand the agent's capabilities as needs evolve
    4. Get alerted on failures and debug issues when sessions go wrong

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Developers Who Want to Learn and Own a Business Process" icon="graduation-cap">
    You believe developers who own business processes — not just write code — are the ones who thrive. You want to level up from coder to process owner.

    **What success looks like for you:**
    1. Learn how business processes work by studying sample agents
    2. Deploy a sample agent for your team to automate a process
    3. Start owning the process and learning how to maintain it
    4. Expand the agent's capabilities as the process evolves

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One-Man CEOs" icon="user-tie">
    You have a business with some traction but you're overwhelmed by repetitive tasks. You need multiple agents handling different parts of your operation so you can focus on what matters.

    **What success looks like for you:**
    1. Deploy multiple agents from ready-made templates
    2. Tweak agents to fit your specific needs
    3. Program human-in-the-loop fallbacks so you get notified when agents can't handle something
    4. Generate ad-hoc agents for new problems as they arise
    5. Turn one-off agents into recurring automations, and recurring ones into fully autonomous processes
    6. Get alerts when agents fail

    **Start here:** Browse the [use case templates](/getting-started/use-cases) — you'll find agents for sales, ops, customer support, and more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Individual Product Developers" icon="code">
    You have a product idea and need the right framework to build it on. You want something that will scale with you and not lock you into a dead end.

    **What success looks like for you:**
    1. Build an MVP with Hive's agent generation framework
    2. Add capabilities easily as your product grows
    3. Trust the framework is future-proof
    4. Wrap agents into your product with a clear deployment strategy
    5. Monitor logs and costs across your user base
