## create an account

To start using Aden, you'll need to create an account on our platform.

1.  Go to the registration URL (https://arp.adenhq.com/register-agent-control).
2.  Sign up using your work email or Google account.
3.  Follow the onboarding steps to set up your workspace.

Once you've created your account, you'll land on the main dashboard where you can manage your integration.

## Generate Developer Token

To authenticate your requests to the Aden API, you need a developer token (API Key).

1.  Log in to your [Aden Dashboard](https://app.adenhq.com).
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Account** > **API Token**.
3.  Click on **Generate New**.
4.  Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Development", "Production").
5.  Click **Create**.
6.  **Important:** Copy the key immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.

<Note>
  Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it or commit it to version control systems like GitHub. Use environment variables to manage your keys securely.
