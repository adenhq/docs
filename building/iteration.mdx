After your agent runs successfully for the first time, the real work begins: making it better. Hive is designed for continuous iteration, from expanding what your agent can do to letting the framework automatically improve it.

## Two Modes of Iteration

### Building Iteration — Expanding Your Agent

After your MVP agent or sample agent runs, you'll want to expand its capabilities. This is like debugging, but forward-looking: instead of fixing what's broken, you're adding what's missing.

Common iteration patterns:

- **Add new integrations** — Connect your agent to additional tools and APIs as your workflow expands
- **Handle more edge cases** — Add nodes and edges that cover scenarios your initial agent didn't address
- **Improve prompts** — Refine node prompts based on real-world output quality
- **Add human-in-the-loop gates** — Insert approval steps for high-risk actions you initially automated
- **Tighten constraints** — Add cost limits, timeout policies, or quality thresholds

<Tip>
Use `hive tui` to test each iteration interactively before deploying. Run the same inputs through your updated agent and compare outputs.
</Tip>

### Production Iteration — Evolution and Adaptation

Once your agent is deployed, your taste and judgment still drive the direction — but AI becomes a significant force multiplier for rapidly iterating and solving problems.

With Aden Cloud, production evolution can be fully automatic. The system runs continuous evaluation cycles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Your agent runs against real-world inputs in production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate">
    Outcomes are measured against your goal's success criteria and constraints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diagnose">
    The framework identifies failure patterns and areas for improvement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regenerate">
    The coding agent proposes changes to prompts, graph structure, edges, or tools.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redeploy">
    Updated agents are deployed and the cycle continues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Version Control

Iteration doesn't always improve everything. Sometimes a change helps one use case but hurts another. Hive includes version control so you can always go back.

```bash
# Restore to a previous version
hive git restore
```

Think of it like git for your agents — every meaningful change is tracked, and you can revert when needed.

## Agent Personality

Not everything should change with iteration. Your agent has a personality — the tone, values, and goals that define who it is. Success isn't about having your agent constantly changing. It's about knowing that **your goal and personality stay fixed while the agent adapts to solve problems**.

When you set up your agent's goal, the core identity persists across evolution cycles. The framework changes *how* the agent achieves the goal, not *what* the goal is.

## Memory Management

As your agent iterates and runs more sessions, memory management becomes important. Hive nodes have built-in mechanisms for:

- **Node memory** — Each node maintains its own working memory within a session
- **Memory passing** — Structured data flows between nodes through edges
- **Cross-session memory** — Persistent memory that survives between runs using memory tools
- **Memory compaction** — Automatic cleanup to prevent unbounded memory growth

For custom memory logic or cross-session persistence, use the memory tools provided by the SDK.

## The Iteration Lifecycle

Over time, your agent should progress through these stages:

| Stage | What You Do | What Hive Does |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **MVP** | Build and test with templates | Generate graph, validate structure |
| **First Success** | Deploy and monitor | Run, log, and surface attention flags |
| **Expansion** | Add integrations and edge cases | Track what works and what fails |
| **Maturity** | Set it and monitor | Evolve automatically based on outcomes |

<Info>
Everything before "First Success" should run as smoothly as possible — this is non-negotiable. The docs, templates, and tools are all designed to get you there fast.

## Contributing Your Improvements

If you've built something useful or found a better way to solve a common problem, share it with the community:

- **Open an issue** on [GitHub](https://github.com/adenhq/hive/issues) if you encounter limitations
- **Share your agent** in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MXE49hrKDk) for feedback
- **Contribute a template** if your agent solves a common business process — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/adenhq/hive/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
