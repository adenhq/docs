## Overview

Aden is a platform for building, deploying, and adapting AI agents. Define your goal through conversation with a coding agent, and the framework generates a node graph with dynamically created connection code. When things break, the framework captures failure data, evolves the agent through the coding agent, and redeploys.

## The Aden Advantage

| Traditional Frameworks | Aden |
|------------------------|------|
| Hardcode agent workflows | Describe goals in natural language |
| Manual graph definition | Auto-generated agent graphs |
| Reactive error handling | Proactive self-evolution |
| Static tool configurations | Dynamic SDK-wrapped nodes |
| DIY budget management | Integrated cost controls |

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph BUILD["Build"]
        GOAL["Define Goal"] --> NODES["Add Nodes"]
        NODES --> EDGES["Connect Edges"]
        EDGES --> TEST["Test & Validate"]
    end

    subgraph EXPORT["Export"]
        JSON["agent.json"]
        TOOLS["tools.py"]
    end

    subgraph RUN["Runtime"]
        LOAD["Load Agent"] --> EXEC["Execute"]
    end

    TEST --> EXPORT
    EXPORT --> LOAD
```

1. **Define Your Goal** - Describe what you want to achieve in plain English
2. **Coding Agent Generates** - Creates the agent graph, connection code, and test cases
3. **Workers Execute** - SDK-wrapped nodes run with full observability and tool access
4. **Self-Improve** - On failure, the system evolves the graph and redeploys automatically

## When to Choose Aden

Choose Aden when you need:

- Agents that **self-improve from failures** without manual intervention
- **Goal-driven development** where you describe outcomes, not workflows
- **Production reliability** with automatic recovery and redeployment
- **Rapid iteration** on agent architectures without rewriting code
- **Human oversight** with built-in human-in-the-loop capabilities
