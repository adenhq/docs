## Build Goal-Driven AI Agents

Aden is a platform for building AI agents that improve themselves. Define your goal through natural language, and the framework generates a node graph with dynamically created connection code. When things break, the framework captures failure data, evolves the agent, and redeploys automatically.

## Why Aden?

Traditional agent frameworks require you to manually design workflows, define agent interactions, and handle failures reactively. Aden flips this paradigm - **you describe outcomes, and the system builds itself**.
