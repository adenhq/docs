## Build Goal-Driven AI Agents

Aden Hive is a framework for building production-grade AI agents without manually wiring rigid workflows. You define outcomes in natural language, and Hive helps generate and run node graphs that can adapt when failures happen.

## Why Aden?

Traditional agent frameworks require manual workflow design, brittle control flow, and reactive fixes. Aden flips this model: **you describe outcomes, and the framework helps build and evolve the system**.

  <Card title="Goal-Driven" icon="bullseye">
    Define objectives in natural language; the coding agent generates graph structure and connection logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Improving" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Runtime failures become inputs for iterative improvement and graph evolution.

  <Card title="Human-in-the-Loop" icon="user">
    Built-in intervention nodes pause execution for human input with configurable timeouts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production-Ready" icon="rocket">
    SDK-wrapped nodes include shared memory, observability, tool access, and control hooks.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run setup wizard
git clone https://github.com/adenhq/hive.git
cd hive
./quickstart.sh

# Build an agent using Claude Code
claude> /hive

# Test your agent
claude> /hive-test

# Run your agent
PYTHONPATH=exports uv run python -m your_agent_name run --input '{...}'
```

## What Makes Aden Different

| Traditional Frameworks | Aden |
|------------------------|------|
| Hardcode agent workflows | Describe goals in natural language |
| Manual graph definition | Auto-generated agent graphs |
| Reactive error handling | Outcome-based adaptation |
| Static tool configurations | Dynamic SDK-wrapped nodes |
| No native intervention model | Built-in HITL and control points |
