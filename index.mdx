## Shared Intelligence for AI Agents

Aden is the orchestration layer that connects your AI agents to a shared memory. Every agent learns from every interaction. Every department's knowledge flows to every other. The more agents you deploy, the smarter they all become.

## The Flywheel Effect

When your Legal team updates a compliance policy, your Sales agent knows instantly. When Support discovers a new edge case, every agent learns from it. Aden creates a network effect inside your organization - each new agent makes all existing agents smarter.
