## Your Developers' Success Is Our Success

Aden Hive is a framework for building production-grade AI agents that automate real business processes. You define outcomes in natural language, and Hive generates adaptive agent graphs that self-improve when failures happen.

We built Hive around a simple principle: **if our developers aren't winning, we aren't winning.** Every feature, every template, every tool exists to help you create agents that work in production — not just in demos.

## What Developer Success Looks Like

Success with Hive follows a clear path. Every developer who uses Hive should be able to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an agent">
    Define your goal in plain language or start from a template. Hive generates the agent graph and connection code for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and debug the agent">
    Run your agent interactively with `hive tui`, use three-level observability to see exactly what happened, and fix issues fast.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the agent">
    Ship to production with `hive deploy` — locally via Docker or to Aden Cloud for zero-ops deployment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain the agent">
    Own the business process. Get alerted on failures, monitor costs, and keep your agent reliable over time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate on the agent">
    Add integrations, expand use cases, and let the evolution loop improve your agent based on real-world outcomes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/adenhq/hive.git
cd hive
./quickstart.sh

# Build an agent with your coding agent
claude> /hive

# Test interactively
hive tui

# Run directly
hive run exports/your_agent_name --input '{"key": "value"}'
```

## Why Aden

Traditional agent frameworks require you to manually wire workflows, handle failures reactively, and rebuild when things change. Aden flips this: **you describe outcomes, the framework builds and evolves itself**.

| Traditional Frameworks | Aden Hive |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Hardcode agent workflows | Describe goals in natural language |
| Manual graph definition | Auto-generated agent graphs |
| Reactive error handling | Outcome-based adaptation |
| Static tool configurations | Dynamic SDK-wrapped nodes |
| No native intervention model | Built-in human-in-the-loop |
| DIY monitoring | Three-level observability built in |
